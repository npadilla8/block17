Workshop: Coffee Menu â˜•
UNIT 2
 
 Overview
You have just been hired at a famous coffee chain as a web developer. Your first assignment is to clean up the menu data and filter it through specific guidelines (prompts two through seven).

Complete the following coding challenges using what you know about debugging and higher-order functions. Some of the questions rely on previous answers, so do your best to complete prompts two through seven in order.

Note: Be sure to console.log and console.table throughout the workshop to check your work.

Getting Started
Create a new repository using this starter code:
// Prompt 1:
// Clean the coffee_data file:

// Checklist:
// a. All prices should be numbers.
// b. All items should be strings.
// c. Objects and properties should have commas seperating them.
// d. Connect the coffee_data.js file to the index.js file.

const coffeeMenu = [
